Intent-Based Chatbot using Python and Streamlit
Overview
This project demonstrates the development of an Intent-Based Chatbot using Python. The chatbot identifies user intents and provides contextually relevant responses using a Logistic Regression model trained on textual data. The application is built with libraries such as nltk, scikit-learn, and Streamlit, making it ideal for learning and deploying simple conversational AI systems.

Features
Intent Recognition: Accurately predicts user intents based on pre-defined patterns.
Customizable Intents: Easily extend the chatbot’s functionality by adding new intents, patterns, and responses.
Streamlit Integration: Provides an intuitive and interactive user interface for seamless conversations.
Pre-Trained Model: Uses TfidfVectorizer and LogisticRegression for efficient text classification.
Educational Use: Ideal for understanding the basics of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning in chatbot development.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Libraries: nltk, scikit-learn, streamlit
Install required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy==1.24.4 scipy==1.10.1 nltk scikit-learn streamlit
How to Run
Training the Chatbot:
Use the chatbot_project.ipynb file to train the chatbot and test its responses.
Running the Streamlit App:
Run the Python script to launch the chatbot interface:
bash
Copy code
streamlit run chatbot_project.py
Example Use Case
Once deployed, the chatbot can:

Greet users
